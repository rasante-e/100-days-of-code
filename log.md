## Days 0 - 6

    ### Day 0 - June 10, 2022

    **Progress:**  Today, and likely the next few days, consisted of a refresher course on Treehouse. It's been a couple of months since the last class of my web development course, so I think reviewing the basics now will save me a lot of time and headache as I venture into more advanced topics and work on my portfolio projects.

    ### Day 1 - June 11, 2022

    **Progress:** Today was a continuation of JavaScript basics as a refrsher to make sure I have a solid foundation before moving onto more advanced topics. The main lessons today were using template literals and Boolean values. I also learned that you can compare strings using the lesser or greater than operator.

    ### Day 6 - June 16, 2022

    **Progress:** Finished jQuery module. Reviewed functions, including return values, arguments and parameters. Also reviewed function declaration vs. function expression. Would like to learn more on the usage of declarations vs. expressions.

    ### Day 7 - June 17, 2022

    **Progress:** Today's lesson was all about arrow functions and assigning default parameters when no arguments are passed, both of which are topics with which I'm not too familiar.
