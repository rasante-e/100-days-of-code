# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Days 0 - 6

    ### Day 0 - June 10, 2022

    **Progress:**  Today, and likely the next few days, consisted of a refresher course on Treehouse. It's been a couple of months since the last class of my web development course, so I think reviewing the basics now will save me a lot of time and headache as I venture into more advanced topics and work on my portfolio projects.

    ### Day 1 - June 11, 2022

    **Progress:** Today was a continuation of JavaScript basics as a refrsher to make sure I have a solid foundation before moving onto more advanced topics. The main lessons today were using template literals and Boolean values. I also learned that you can compare strings using the lesser or greater than operator.

    ### Day 2 - June 12, 2022

    **Progress:** Today's work involved a review of using conditional statements with multiple options, as well as a refresher on numbers in JS.

    ### Day 3 - June 13, 2022

    **Progress:** Reviewed the math object in JavaScript and the methods available to that object. I also began an overview of creating functions.

    ### Day 4 - June 14, 2022

    **Progress:** Switched it up today and did some Boostrap lessons on Free Code Camp. Reviewed the basic grid layout of Bootstrap, which is the basis of page structure, as well as different options for styling images, texts, buttons and form entries.

    ### Day 5 - June 15, 2022

    **Progress:** Finished the Bootstrap module on Free Code Camp and started jQuery. I briefly learned some jQuery years ago, but a lot of this is new to me.

    ### Day 6 - June 16, 2022

    **Progress:** Finished jQuery module. Reviewed functions, including return values, arguments and parameters. Also reviewed function declaration vs. function expression. Would like to learn more on the usage of declarations vs. expressions.
