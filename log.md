## Days 0 - 6

    ### Day 0 - June 10, 2022

    **Progress:**  Today, and likely the next few days, consisted of a refresher course on Treehouse. It's been a couple of months since the last class of my web development course, so I think reviewing the basics now will save me a lot of time and headache as I venture into more advanced topics and work on my portfolio projects.
